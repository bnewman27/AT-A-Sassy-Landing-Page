SCSS Landing Page Activity
In this activity, I used various SCSS features to recreate the styling of a generic landing page. The goal was to demonstrate my understanding of variables, nesting, at-rules, mixins, includes, and content.

Getting Started

EITHER 

view page via "https://bnewman27.github.io/AT-A-Sassy-Landing-Page/"

OR

Clone the repository provided and navigate to the style.scssfile. 
Install a Sass compiling extension and serve the index.html
in your browser using live-server for reference.

Utility Partials
Utilizes three partials to store utilities: 
_utilities.scss, 
_btnConfig.scss,
 and 
_config.scss.


This project utilizes:

Languages:
HTML: for the landing page structure
SCSS: for styling the landing page using various features such as variables, nesting, at-rules, mixins, includes, and content.
CSS: for compiled SCSS

Tech:
variables, nesting, at-rules, mixins, includes, and content.

When finished, open the link provided, or index.html in Live Server, to ensure that the landing page mirrors the example given in the instructions.
